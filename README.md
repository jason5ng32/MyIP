## 📕 How to Use

There are 3 Ways to deploy:

### Deploying in a Node Environment

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Clone the code:

git clone https://github.com/jason5ng32/MyIP.git
```

Install:

```bash
npm install
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run:

```bash
npm start
```

The program will run on port 18966.

### Using Vercel

Click the 'Deploy to Vercel' button at the top to complete the deployment.

### Using Docker

Click the 'Deploy to Docker' button at the top to complete the deployment. Or, use the following shell:

```bash
docker run -d -p 18966:18966 --name myip --restart always jason5ng32/myip:latest
```

## 📚 Environment Variable

You can use the program without adding any environment variables, but if you want to use some advanced features, you can add the following environment variables:

| Variable Name | Required | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | No | `18966` | The port on which the program runs |
| `BING_MAP_API_KEY` | No | `""` | API Key for Bing Maps, used to display the location of the IP on a map |
| `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | No | `""` | Allowed domains for access, separated by commas, used to prevent misuse of the backend API |
| `IPCHECKING_API_KEY` | No | `""` | API Key for IPCheck.ing, used to obtain accurate IP geolocation information |
| `IPINFO_API_TOKEN` | No | `""` | API Token for IPInfo.io, used to obtain IP geolocation information through IPInfo.io |
| `KEYCDN_USER_AGENT` | No | `""` | The domain name when using KeyCDN, must contain https prefix. Used to obtain IP address information through KeyCDN |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API` | No | `""` | API Key for Cloudflare, used to obtain AS system information through Cloudflare |
| `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` | No | `""` | Google reCAPTCHA's Site Key, used to display reCAPTCHA verification on the frontend |
| `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` | No | `""` | Google reCAPTCHA's Secret Key, used to verify reCAPTCHA verification on the backend |

### Using Environment Variables in a Node Environment

Create environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Modify `.env`, and for example, add the following:

```bash
PORT=18966
BING_MAP_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
ALLOWED_DOMAINS="example.com"
IPCHECKING_API="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

Then restart the backend service.

### Using Environment Variables in Vercel

Please refer to the content in `.env.example` and add it to the environment variables in Vercel.

### Using Environment Variables in Docker

You can add environment variables when running Docker, for example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 18966:18966 \
  -e BING_MAP_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  -e ALLOWED_DOMAINS="example.com" \
  -e IPCHECKING_API="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  --name myip \
  jason5ng32/myip:latest

```

## 👩🏻‍💻 Advanced Usage

If you're using a proxy for internet access, consider adding this rule to your proxy configuration (modify it according to your client). This setup lets you check both your real IP and the IP when using the proxy:

```ini
# IP Testing
IP-CIDR,1.0.0.1/32,DIRECT,no-resolve
IP-CIDR6,2606:4700:4700::1111/128,DIRECT,no-resolve
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,ipify.org,Proxy
# Rule Testing
DOMAIN,ptest-1.ipcheck.ing,Proxy1
DOMAIN,ptest-2.ipcheck.ing,Proxy2
DOMAIN,ptest-3.ipcheck.ing,Proxy3
DOMAIN,ptest-4.ipcheck.ing,Proxy4
DOMAIN,ptest-5.ipcheck.ing,Proxy5
DOMAIN,ptest-6.ipcheck.ing,Proxy6
DOMAIN,ptest-7.ipcheck.ing,Proxy7
DOMAIN,ptest-8.ipcheck.ing,Proxy8
```
