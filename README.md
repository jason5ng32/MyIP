## 📕 How to Use

There are 3 Ways to deploy:

### Deploying in a Node Environment

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Clone the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jason5ng32/MyIP.git
```

Install:

```bash
npm install
```

Run:

```bash
npm start
```

The program will run on port 8966.

If you want to add Bing Maps, make the following changes before starting:

Create environment variables:

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

Modify the Bing Maps API Key and your domain (to prevent abuse) in `.env` .

```bash
BING_MAP_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
ALLOWED_DOMAINS="example.com"
```

If you want to use IP2Location.io API, you can also add the following:

```bash
IP2LOCATIONIO_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

If you want to use IPInfo.io API, you can also add the following:

```bash
IPINFO_API_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Using Vercel

Click the 'Deploy to Vercel' button at the top to complete the deployment.

If you want to display maps, set the following 2 environment variables during deployment:

```bash
BING_MAP_API_KEY
ALLOWED_DOMAINS
```

If you want to use IP2Location.io API, you can also add the following:

```bash
IP2LOCATIONIO_API_KEY
```

If you want to use IPInfo.io API, you can also add the following:

```bash
IPINFO_API_TOKEN
```

### Using Docker

Click the 'Deploy to Docker' button at the top to complete the deployment. Or, use the following shell:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8966:8966 --name myip --restart always jason5ng32/myip:latest
```

If you wish to display maps, set the Bing Map API Key and allowed domains during deployment:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8966:8966 \
  -e BING_MAP_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  -e ALLOWED_DOMAINS="example.com" \
  --name myip \
  jason5ng32/myip:latest

```

If you want to use IP2Location.io API, you can also add the following:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8966:8966 \
  -e BING_MAP_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  -e ALLOWED_DOMAINS="example.com" \
  -e IP2LOCATIONIO_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  --name myip \
  jason5ng32/myip:latest

```

If you want to use IPInfo.io API, you can also add the following:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8966:8966 \
  -e BING_MAP_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  -e ALLOWED_DOMAINS="example.com" \
  -e IPINFO_API_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  --name myip \
  jason5ng32/myip:latest

```

## 👩🏻‍💻 Advanced Usage

If you're using a proxy for internet access, consider adding this rule to your proxy configuration (modify it according to your client). This setup lets you check both your real IP and the IP when using the proxy:

```ini
# IP Testing
IP-CIDR,1.0.0.1/32,DIRECT,no-resolve
IP-CIDR6,2606:4700:4700::1111/128,DIRECT,no-resolve
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,ipify.org,Proxy
```

## 😶‍🌫️ Additional Notes

70% of the code for this program was not written by me, but generated through ChatGPT. After about 90 rounds of back-and-forth and some minor manual adjustments, all the code was completed.
