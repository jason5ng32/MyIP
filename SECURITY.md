## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our project is a top priority. If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it directly through our GitHub Issues.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

1. **Report Through GitHub Issues**: Please create a new issue in our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/jason5ng32/MyIP/issues). Provide a clear and detailed description of the potential vulnerability. Include steps to reproduce it, if possible.

2. **Avoid Public Disclosure**: To protect the community, please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

3. **Response Time**: We aim to respond to security issue reports within 48 hours, acknowledging receipt.

4. **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress on the issue through the GitHub Issues thread.

5. **Credit**: We value your contribution to the security of this project. We will acknowledge your efforts in the GitHub Issue thread and in our release notes, if a fix is implemented.

## Security Update Process

Upon receiving a report of a vulnerability, our team will:

- Promptly investigate the issue.
- Develop a fix and test it thoroughly.
- Release an updated version that addresses the issue.
- Provide updates and patches as needed.

Thank you for helping us keep our project safe and secure.
